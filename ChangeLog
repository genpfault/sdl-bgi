Changelog
---------

v. 2.3.0, 2019-08-01

- added 'auto mode': initgraph() performs automatic screen refresh
  when the environment variable SDL_BGI_RATE is set to 'auto' or to
  the desired refresh rate (e.g. 60). This can be used as an
  alternative to 'slow mode', and it provides a huge performance
  boost. The new function sdlbgiauto() is also available. BEWARE:
  automatic refresh may not work on some NVIDIA graphics cards.
  Patch provided by Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita.
