This is SDL_bgi, a graphics library based on SDL2. SDL_bgi provides
graphics primitives, and is much easier to use than SDL2.

SDL_bgi is nearly fully compatible with BGI, the Borland Graphics
Interface that was the de facto standard in PC graphics back in DOS
days. (It compiles and runs the original 'bgidemo.c' almost
perfectly.) It's pretty fast, very easy to use, and it also provides
extensions for ARGB colours and mouse support. It should run on any
platform supported by SDL2; it was only tested in Linux, though.

I wrote SDL_bgi because I wanted a simple but fast graphics library
for my experiments with fractals and cellular automata, using the BGI
syntax I'm used to. Obviously, native SDL2 functions can be used in
SDL_bgi programs.

A few examples are provided in the src/test/ directory.

If you don't need BGI compatibility, I suggest that you check out
SDL_gfx, a graphics library more complete and more powerful than
SDL_bgi.
